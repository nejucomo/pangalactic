# Let's Hack Pangalactic!

So you wanna hack on pangalactic, eh?

The first step is quick and easy, take the *Pangalactic Oath*:

> I dedicate some of my time toward improving pangalactic as I see fit in service of our glorious mission to explore all of the Milky Way.

Don't fret about such an audacious Oath; we may fail, but it's worth a shot.

## Prerequisites
