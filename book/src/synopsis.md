# Synopsis

Pangalactic aspires to become a decentralized data network tailored towards using deterministic computation for revision control and build systems. The flagship application built on this network is `pg`, a decentralized revision control tool, similar to git, monotone, mercurial, fossil, and so forth.

Pangalactic is _very much_ an incomplete work in progress. The existing functionality is spotty, as well as the documentation in this book.
