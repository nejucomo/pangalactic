# Tutorial

This tutorial guides users through basic usage of the Pangalactic revision control tool provided by the `pg` commandline utility. It assumes the reader is familiar with `git` and provides examples using the `bash` shell.

## Installation

The `pg` tool is provided through the Rust language `cargo` packaging system:

```bash
$ cargo install pangalactic
```

Verify the install:

```bash
$ pg --version
```

## Next Step

With `pg` at hand, we'll explore the most basic revision control, then introduce some decentralized collaboration concepts of `pg`.
