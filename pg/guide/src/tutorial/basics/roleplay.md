# A Little Roleplay

This tutorial shows both some basic revision control a single person might do, and also how people can collaborate across the internet, so you'll assume a couple of roles to simulate this.

First, let's create a directory to work through the tutorial examples.

```bash
$ mkdir ~/pg-tutorial
$ cd ~/pg-tutorial
```

Now, let's assume the role of a hacker named Alice. We'll perform her actions inside her own subdirectory:

```bash
$ mkdir alice
$ cd alice
```

## Next step

Next we'll explore basic repository actions a single user, like Alice,
performs on her own work.
